Introduction
============

A Archetypes-based content-type named 'Subsection', being nothing but a folder
extended with a richtext-field, so users *don't* have to:

1.) Create a folder
2.) Create a page and then
3.) Set the page to be the default-view of the folder

Instead simply adding a Subsection will do all that in one step.
