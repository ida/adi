Introduction
============

A voting app for Plone.

You can add a discussable and in it add arguments about the discussable.

E.g. the discussable is "Guaranteed basic healthcare for all citizens", then you'd add an argument
"Less costs when people get older, because they are healthier".
If you think that's not a good one, you can add a conter-argument to the given argument, f.e.:
"More costs, because people live longer."

Each argument can be upvoted by users. There's a report showing pro- and contra-arguments and compute
which have more weight by the amount of pro/con and the given upvotes.

You cannot downvote an argument, you must provide a conter-argument, whcih then again can be upvoted.
No mere click-downvotes possible. If you have a crtitique must put it in an argument.
